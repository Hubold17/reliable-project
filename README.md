# Welcome
to my journey, where I discover the possibilities and challenges in implementing a **reliable** transport protocol with a **sliding window**.

This was a small project from the bachelor course "Computer Networks" of ETH Zurich in my 4th Semester.

**Only** the file reliable.c was modified according to the task, the rest (like lib.c, tester, reliable_no_response) were given as part of the task.
